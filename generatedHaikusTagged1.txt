To limping setting town
A lice crow of sun
A spring sparrow feel

Up sun knife stranger
Another crow movie than fire
A limb sparrow can

Out dawn ants moonlight
The night teeth in leaf
The ebbs button can

Out snail limping ants

The sky woods of strands
A road flowers dangling

To returns evening glows
This sun new so wind
A rat moon stumbles

To anger music bud

The feather tomatoes came

Out haunch tree sinking
A washerwoman hairpin with way
A stars way shifts

Out spring years boy
