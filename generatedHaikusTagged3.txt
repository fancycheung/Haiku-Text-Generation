A man room strands
Out cigarette popcorn of was
Are tree fails pruning

A stars popcorn wind
To mountains doctor of river
Is sea day timing

The mouse lies took
Out lines world on haunch
Make summer fails were

Which woman birds dawn
To horse crow amid moon
Could shadow head am

A name stoops blossom
To haunch farm of blood
Sizzling autumn bottle am

This crow snowflakes ribbon
Up evening rain at body
Taking tree sounds searching

The trickles kitten flood
To stumps sail by flood
Plowing spring night shifts

A china dawn dirty
Out evening fields as stands
Is sparrow whore atop

The rain crow rain
To stones birds in blooming
Making bull moon is

The wire pane wind
Out lake leg of streets
Open seashore blazing sleeps

The butt evening taste
To sea circus from \u2013
Whirling viper popcorn pruning

A ice woman moon
Up evening rain on sleeves
Spitting turnips feel tree

The blossoms spring pavements
Down way flowers into leaves
Sharpening \u2013 seen closing

Out stares something into bit
Are beak cloth \u2014

A window stands blade
Up ship scarecrow of thunder
Creates butterfly snowball decorated

The woods seashore poppies
Up door tongue as flood
Atop water autumn is

The graveyard becomes grow
Out sunlit anger into sill
Seeing field wire smelt

A sleep smile spring
Down wire rent as branch
Tasting rat creeping atop

An spring snow jumps
To anger snow of feet

To mountains snow on idiot
Dragging stranger summer will

A grow autumn earth
To cloud sawdust into sill
Holding evening dog seasoning

The dawn sky gleams
To apple spring on streets

The limping returns magnolia
To moon sizzling on seen
Shows stove winter clinging

Up house took upon bell
Standing nobody spiders reads

The tulip spider returns
To leg blazing upon face
Rouse hair circus spanks

An nose wood moonlight
Down dank wing of excrement
Grow sky rat flung

A woods sprig flower
To shadow twitching amid summer
Can ants was wears

A window summer are
To circus melon in raindrops
Sticking fields something have

A winter stumps splits
To shoe stars while sky
Walks autumn magpies taking

A stars pine snail
To head setting in icicles
Explain embers box find

Every gleams shrill world
Out village season of day
Am immigrants sparrows crack

The body roses sea
Out cat stars at crow
Tossing raindrops grass are

The garden \u2013 soap
To lake trunk of tree
Recall dawn crow shifts

A baby weight day
To autumn bayonet in dank
Driving blossoms passes goes

The scarecrow flute doll
To twitching trumpeting so webs
Is washerwoman cock spilling

The coffin autumn lacy

Spitting spreading chirps timing

A melon butt fly
Up watchfulness summer at river

Up webs town at spring
Shyly clang drops left

To cloud princess upon wagon
Swam moments rain begins

A goose hair village
To nobody are of sunlit
Glittering stone sunflower sparrows

Another shadow lies blacksmith
Over heaps deeply in sky
Searching darting sprig crying

The crow twitching caught
Over returns wind with weight
Is lines sizzling stumbles

That season lake snow
To heat bells of pot
Has window becomes have

A lake spring dawn
To mornings farm at hair

An haunch spiders pillow
To sunlit sky at wood
Will world beach is

A snow moonlight jumps

Flicking limping moonlight coming

A flowers wood autumn
Over pauses fur in flowers
Washing crow seashore fall

A new spring stands
Up into sun under lacy

The butterfly time bud
To stench sun on sunflower
Sticking valley spring is

The sparrow princess plum
Down town winter as moonlight
Dragging creeping advertising are

That darting sneeze christmas
To doll doll in stones
Passing bottle spring licked

To lips sea with cherries
Paying immigrants chirps stop

An immigrants sun name
Up spreading tree in coffin
Flung button sparrow straightens

The winter autumn lice
To window lips of dignity
Feel bucket stone standing

Every bit burning evening
To haunch dawn behind tree
Goes handkerchief shadow dyes

A barn hum baby
Out princess scarecrow in drenches
Tolling cat circus is
